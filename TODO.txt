Possible fixes.... bah dum 
1.remove comma from sentence in features\visiting things
2. "tab" is unecessarily hyperlinked in features\adding a comment, features\editing a comment, features\removing a Thing from a play, features\liking a Plan. featu
3.

- rate a thing without commenting
- Name and email not required and bio required
- disliking a thing means un-liking. No actual dislike
- maybe change dislike to favorite since there is already a rating system
- reccommendations should be sorting by rating and not alphabetically
- search for categories
- next to someones name add # of reviews instead of # of comments
- min stars go over 5
- duration specify units
- duration while searching for a thing is buggy
- can't search for plans
- limited types under each category
- idk what neighborhood is when creating a thing
- all filters go into negatives
- neighborhood shouldn't be required when creating a thing
- can't search for profiles or things created under that profile
- you can only search for plans under your own profile but it shows things instead
